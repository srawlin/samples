LLF was born out of a collaborative effort with Think Local First DC and seeks to partner with local musicians, local arts organizations, local venues and locally owned businesses to create performance opportunities and new avenues for local music exploration. LLF's mission is not genre specific. In order to promote the true cultural depth of DC's music scene LLF would seek to equally represent all local genres, from folk to funk.

Those of my big brother: the first grunge bands; Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth. And of course my own first tapes with Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen. Later on the walkman was replaced with a discman. My first cd_éìs; Dr. Dre, Mark Oh and Atlantic Ocean. True Dr. Dre I discovered hip hop. And hip hop made me discover soul and jazz. Through friends my collection got bigger with Led Zeppelin and The Doors. My exploration for _éïnew_éì music went like a time travel. From the 60_éìs to the 80_éìs and from the 70_éìs back to now. From electronic music to classical and from folk to indie music. Nowadays I'm lucky to combine this passion for music in my daily job as a studio & project manager at Amp.Amsterdam and managing the Dynamic Reflection and Soulfood record labels.

There is quite a bit of free music out there for your ears, but free download doesn't always mean it's good. RBG is a way to help you guide your way through what to download. Basically, our reviews say (for the most part) ""This is a great album and you can download it for free so you should"".We also really like cassettes and physical forms of music which can be purchased to help support artists. While we have always had the theory of music being best when it is free, listening to something without paying for it is not going to help anyone and if you want the bands you like to continue to make music then you should grab a cassette, t-shirt, see them live, whatever. Just give your money to bands you like or else they might no longer be there.",,valid,WordPress,Rap Basement,http://www.rapbasement.com/,rapbasementcs@gmail.com,,,,Hip Hop,"Los Angeles, CA, USA",@rap_basement,Hip Hop & Urban Lifestyle,,valid,WordPress,320585Rap Blog,http://www.rapblog.ch,info@rapblog.ch,,,,Rap / Hip Hop,Switzerland,,,,valid,WordPress,2587406Rap Burger,http://www.rapburger.com,rapburger@gmail.com,,,,Hip Hop / R&B,Italy,@RapBurger,,,valid,WordPress,220614Rap Con Queso,http://www.rapconqueso.com ,submissions@Rapconqueso.com,,,Submisions,Hip Hop / R&B,Florida,@RapConQueso,"Welcome to RapConQueso, your new home for all your Hip-hop and gaming needs.

Above all, we remain strictly dedicated to receiving new artists, their projects and the ideas behind them. Through meticulous exploration we ensure that we are constantly progressing and pushing the limits of our expression.More than any particular style, the defining characteristic of the music you will find here is originality. From the darkest and deepest corners of the club to the brightest resonant highs, the creativity and audacity of each artist is paramount. What we can absolutely guarantee is that the work we are sharing with you has veritable meaning. Humans respond to feelings and we strongly believe that as well as being heard, music must also be felt; it must induce a reaction in people.Ultimately, our existence is dictated by our collective passion for music. With this boundless appreciation we will continue to release and share our favourite work for you to enjoy. Our story will continue to evolve and we sincerely hope you will be a part of it. We are excited to continue promoting talented and forward thinking producers and we look forward to an extraordinary fulfilling and enterprising future.

Often sleaze bands came across better live then in a studio that tried to harness their aggression. They were at the top of their game when touring on the road, abusing drugs and alcohol and having sex with your daughters or wives. The look and attitude also separated them from other bands. Long hair that looks like it's been washed with used motorcycle oil, black leather jackets and tight pants, and tattoos proudly displayed from head to toe are all trademarks of a true sleaze band. They truly were the outlaws of rock 'n' roll.   As you can see, this site encompasses more than just sleaze.

It doesn't even taste like apples."" and then the friends go back and forth with each other trying to come up with a reason why they like the cereal, and all they can come up with is, ""We just do."" Anywho, the whole catch phrase they based their reasoning for liking Apple Jacks was, ""We eat what we like.""I wanted a blog to exist that supported new musicians, while at the same time, reviving some forgotten ones.
